# build with the vendored deps, then ship the static binary on alpine: small, but keeps a shell
# so you can `docker exec -it embyfin-mcp sh` to poke at things. runs as a non-root user.
# make docker passes VERSION/COMMIT from git; a bare `docker build .` reports "dev".
#
# REGISTRY is where the two base images come from: Google's mirror of Docker Hub, which holds
# the same images, unless a build says otherwise. Docker Hub itself (docker.io/library) limits
# how much an address may pull, which a CI runner's shared address runs into; CI builds again
# from it when the mirror gives nothing. Nothing here needs a newer Dockerfile syntax than every
# builder has, so no syntax image is named: that was a third thing to fetch before a build.
